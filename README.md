## TIC TAC TOE GAME


# About the game

The game involves two players each assigned a symbol X OR O. If any of the players has all his symbols aligned either horizontally,vertically ,diagnoally or antidiagnolly first then he/she becomes the winner. Otherwise, if the board is full and none of them has won then the game is a draw and thus game over.
